# Warehouse Management üè¨

An application to manage the inventory in multiple warehouses of a business. The products will be stored in groups and user can create any number of groups. In a particular group any number of products can be added along with the whole information of the product.

Suppose there is big business of toys. A lot of wholesale and retail Sales takes place in a day and the business has multiple warehouses and each warehouse has multiple Floors in it.

The business would require an App (can be used by multiple people at a time) that would:
- Help to keep track of all the stocks in all the warehouses of all products.
- Help to quicky locate where the stock of a specific product lies in the warehouses.
- Help to get the price of a specific product (helps in a situation when a customer wants to know the price of the product from manager/salesperson)
- Help to get all available variety of a particular product (For ex: If salesperson want all available types of a ‚Äúbat‚Äù he might get result: [‚ÄúPlastic bat small‚Äù, ‚ÄúLeather bat‚Äù, etc])
